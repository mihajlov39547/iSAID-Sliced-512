# iSAID-512Tiles

512√ó512 sliced image tiles and YOLO-format annotations derived from the iSAID aerial imagery dataset, created by Marko Mihajlovic for academic use in instance segmentation.

---

## üìö Dataset Overview

This dataset consists of approximately **10,000 image tiles** derived from the iSAID dataset, which itself is based on DOTA-v1.0.

- **Author**: Marko Mihajlovic  
- **Affiliation**: Singidunum University, Belgrade, Serbia  
- **GitHub**: [https://github.com/mihajlov39547/iSAID-Sliced-512](https://github.com/mihajlov39547/iSAID-Sliced-512)

- **Original imagery source**:  
  DOTA-v1.0 dataset, sourced from Google Earth, GF‚Äë2, and JL‚Äë1 satellites.  
  The iSAID dataset builds upon DOTA by providing instance-level pixel annotations for segmentation tasks.  
  This tile dataset (iSAID-512Tiles) is built on top of the iSAID dataset by slicing large images into 512√ó512 patches.

## üè∑Ô∏è Object Categories

The following categories are inherited from iSAID (which uses DOTA's classes):

```
0: plane  
1: ship  
2: storage tank  
3: baseball diamond  
4: tennis court  
5: basketball court  
6: ground track field  
7: harbor  
8: bridge  
9: large vehicle  
10: small vehicle  
11: helicopter  
12: roundabout  
13: soccer ball field  
14: swimming pool
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Annotation Format

Each `.txt` annotation file uses YOLO normalized format:

```
<class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>
```

Values range from 0 to 1.

## üîß How to Generate Test Dataset

1. Download full-resolution iSAID and DOTA datasets.
2. Use the official devkit:  
   [https://github.com/CAPTAIN-WHU/iSAID_Devkit](https://github.com/CAPTAIN-WHU/iSAID_Devkit)
3. Use the `split.py` script to divide large iSAID images into 512√ó512 tiles.
4. Generate YOLO-compatible annotations for each tile using bounding box conversion scripts.
5. Organize into train/val/test sets in YOLO folder structure.

## üß™ Evaluation & Competition

To evaluate results on the original iSAID benchmark:

- Submit a `.json` file (COCO-style) to the official iSAID evaluation server.
- Receive mAP and per-class AP via email.
- One submission allowed per user per day.
- A method description (‚â• 120 words) in English is required.

For local evaluation, use the official devkit‚Äôs script:
```bash
python evaluate/evaluate.py
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Full-resolution iSAID and DOTA datasets must be downloaded separately.
- This repository contains only 512√ó512 sliced tiles and YOLO-format annotations.
- Use the devkit to reproduce large image splits or to evaluate performance against the benchmark.
